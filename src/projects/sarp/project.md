The [Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership](https://southeastaquatics.net/) (SARP) is a regional initiative dedicated to conserving aquatic resources in the Southeast, and one of the nation's first Fish Habitat Partnerships. SARP and SECAS staff work closely together on everything from improving data for the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to identifying focus areas, funding projects to fill data gaps, developing online viewers, aligning measures of success, and more.

SARP synthesizes data for two aquatic indicators in the Southeast Blueprint. The first, imperiled aquatic species, uses State Natural Heritage data to measure the number of aquatic animal Species of Greatest Conservation Need observed in each watershed. The second, network complexity, uses SARP's aquatic barrier database to count the number of connected stream size classes in a river network between dams or waterfalls. SECAS recently collaborated with SARP to improve and expand these datasets in West Virginia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of our effort to use consistent data and methods regionwide for both the Blueprint and SARP's [Barrier Prioritization Tool](https://aquaticbarriers.org/). These additional states and territories have now formally joined SARP, aligning the SARP and SECAS geographies.

In addition, SARP's Steering Committee recently adopted the Blueprint to represent their priority areas. Staff also continue to discuss how the [SECAS Goal Report](https://secassoutheast.org/our-goal) can inform an update to SARP's [Southeast Aquatic Habitat Plan](https://southeastaquatics.net/about/our-work/conservation-planning/sahp) to measure regional trends in metrics like riparian health and aquatic connectivity. SARP will use the Blueprint and Goal Report in future decisions about where to implement actions and allocate resources on the ground, as well as monitor aquatic ecosystem trends to support collective discussions about adaptive management.
