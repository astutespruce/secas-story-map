Fish and wildlife agencies for at least 11 states and 2 territories (AL, AR, GA, KY, MS, NC, LA, OK, SC, TN, VA, PR, USVI) are using the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to inform ongoing updates to their state and territorial Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs). SWAPs guide each agency's strategic conservation efforts to support species of concern known as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN). SWAPs represent an amazing repository of science, expert opinion, and collaboration with partners and the wider public. They also provide a framework for fish and wildlife agencies to coordinate with their neighbors to conserve species and their habitats regionwide.

Many of these state and territorial agencies are combining the Southeast Blueprint with other state and local data to identify or refine their Conservation Opportunity Areas (COAs). COAs are specific geographies that, due to the presence and condition of key habitats, are particularly important for SGCN. They also serve as focus areas to rally partners around collective conservation action. As a consistent regional plan, the Blueprint is helping fish and wildlife agencies better align their COAs across state lines.

In addition, SECAS staff are also helping some agencies write an additional chapter for their SWAPs. These chapters highlight how each state or territory contributes to the regional landscape, drawing on existing resources like the Blueprint and its underlying connectivity analysis, the [SECAS Goal Report](https://secassoutheast.org/our-goal), [plant](https://secassoutheast.org/2023/12/18/The-nations-first-RSGCN-list-for-plants) and [animal Regional SGCN](https://secassoutheast.org/2019/09/30/Priorities-for-Conservation-in-Southeastern-States.html), climate resilience and adaptation information, and areas important to key partners and regional partnerships. They also help increase consistency of SWAPs across jurisdictions and introduce a landscape-level perspective. These chapters help each agency not only support their own SGCN, but also consider priorities they share with other states to find new ways to work together.
