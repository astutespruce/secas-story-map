The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is contributing to the restoration of longleaf pine across its historic range by helping longleaf Local Implementation Teams (LITs) prioritize their conservation and management efforts. Longleaf pine forests, with towering trees and open, grassy understories, once spanned 90 million acres from Virginia to Texas. Fire suppression, deforestation, and land-use changes reduced it to only 3% of its former range by the late 1990s. Thanks in part to [The Longleaf Alliance](https://longleafalliance.org/) and [America's Longleaf Restoration Initiative](http://americaslongleaf.org/), the longleaf pine forest is now on its way back to prominence.


Seventeen LITs are currently working throughout nine states to manage existing longleaf forests and implement restoration projects. The teams are made up of government agencies, conservation organizations, industry, and private landowners, all sharing resources, ideas and best practices. LITs are drafting conservation plans, identifying collective goals and developing landscape-scale maps to help assess, visualize and track collective longleaf restoration priorities. America's Longleaf and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are encouraging LITs to share these priorities in a "Longleaf Restoration Road Map" to improve range-wide communication and planning.


The Longleaf Alliance has been working closely with LITs and the larger conservation community to collect relevant spatial data, facilitate discussions, and develop priority maps. The Southeast Blueprint proved instrumental in identifying potential high-quality habitat areas for open pine systems outside of partner lands. It also supported data compatibility across the range. In particular, three LITs have applied the Blueprint as a key element in their mapping process:


* Chattahoochee Fall Line Conservation Partnership (GA and AL)
* SoLo-ACE Longleaf Partnership (SC)
* DeSoto/Camp-Shelby Local Implementation Team (MS and AL)


These projects used the Blueprint to help map strategic restoration targets to achieve tangible conservation outcomes and support range-wide conservation planning efforts for longleaf.
