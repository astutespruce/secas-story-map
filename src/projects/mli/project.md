When a neighboring landscape conservation partnership, the [Midwest Landscape Initiative](https://www.mlimidwest.org/) (MLI), decided to create a [Midwest Conservation Blueprint](https://mcap-fws.hub.arcgis.com/pages/midwest-conservation-blueprint), this presented a great opportunity for cross-regional integration. Staff from SECAS and MLI have worked closely together ever since to share methods, data, and language across boundaries.


A shared commitment to developing consistent information and supporting users has made it much easier to collaborate across regional lines--especially for states like Missouri and Kentucky that participate in both partnerships and sit on the boundary between the Midwest and Southeast. Both initiatives continue to find new ways of convening partners, filling data gaps, and sharing lessons learned to achieve our common goals of healthy, functional, and connected ecosystems.
