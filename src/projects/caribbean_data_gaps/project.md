Addressing inconsistencies in data availability and access in the U.S. Caribbean has been a major recent focus of the SECAS partnership. In 2023, SECAS completed a long-overdue update to the Southeast Conservation Blueprint that covered the U.S. Virgin Islands and developed finer-scale priorities for Puerto Rico for the first time. As part of our efforts to make up for lost time, SECAS is now helping coordinate the [Caribbean Conservation Community of Practice](https://secasc.ncsu.edu/resources/caribbean-community-of-practice/) and advocating for other regional and national data providers to extend foundational information resources to these islands that all too often get left out.

So far, [SECAS staff have worked with the Protected Areas Database of the United States team](https://secassoutheast.org/2024/06/25/Working-to-improve-existing-datasets-a-spotlight-on-PAD-US.html) to successfully improve protected areas coverage in Puerto Rico by connecting to existing datasets, and are laying the groundwork for future improvements in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We also supported a proposal to fund the development of next-generation urban growth projections, tested improvements to the Trust for Public Land's ParkServe viewer as they expanded their data to Puerto Rico, met with LANDFIRE staff to advocate for continued refinements to their U.S. Caribbean landcover, and funded the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership to compile better data on imperiled aquatic species.

While much remains to be done, SECAS is committed to leading by example by regularly updating the Southeast Blueprint in the U.S. Caribbean and expanding its coverage of the offshore marine environment in the future.
