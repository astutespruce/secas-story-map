The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is helping inform energy siting decisions as part of several state and regional tools. The Nature Conservancy in Georgia partnered with conservation groups, developers, and utilities to launch a publicly available tool that can support Georgia decision-makers as they seek win-win outcomes for both conservation and energy independence. The [GA Low Impact Solar Siting Tool](http://bit.ly/GALowImpactSolar) (LISST) was developed to help guide solar development across the state and streamline environmental assessments for proposed developments. This tool uses the Southeast Blueprint as a foundational environmental sensitivity dataset to help identify places to avoid. This collaborative approach helps improve the efficiency of energy siting, which can reduce the regulatory burden for utility companies as they strive to meet the energy demands of growing communities. At the same time, it helps minimize negative impacts to important species and habitats.


This has sparked the development of comparable tools in South Carolina and Mississippi that use a similar approach to encourage large-scale solar development projects in more suitable areas with lower environmental sensitivity and less potential for negative impacts to wildlife. 


Additionally, you can now find the Blueprint in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's national [Information for Conservation Planning and Consultation](https://ipac.ecosphere.fws.gov/) (IPaC) tool, which streamlines the environmental review process by identifying impacted resources like migratory birds and endangered species and recommending ways to improve project design, helping developers make more informed decisions when siting energy and other projects. IPaC was recently used to help steer offshore wind leases to less sensitive areas of the Gulf of America that are not prioritized in the Blueprint.


Using the Southeast Blueprint as a common building block across multiple states and tools improves regional alignment for better coordination and efficient use of resources.
