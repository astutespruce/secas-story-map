In 2023, the Southeast Conservation Blueprint expanded to the offshore waters of the Gulf of America for the first time. SECAS staff worked with partners to find the best available data to represent key resources in the Gulf marine environment. As part of our commitment to avoid duplicating the good work of others, SECAS builds on existing datasets wherever possible, often using them in innovative ways to help the conservation community make the best of the resources we already have.


To start, staff pulled together sea turtle and marine mammal models from the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (GoMMAPPS), marine highly migratory fish models from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, and deep-sea coral models from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). One obvious gap was hardbottom habitat.


To better represent Gulf hardbottom in the Southeast Blueprint, SECAS staff combined a suite of different data sources into a new indicator, including sediments from usSEABED; artificial reef, shipwreck, and deep-sea coral locations from NOAA; hardbottom and associated species data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; and others. Recognizing that this first attempt at a Gulf hardbottom indicator had plenty of room for improvement, staff refined their approach in 2024 and convened a team of 15 experts to review the data and methods. As a result, the 2024 indicator uses better artificial reef and shipwreck data, incorporates new coral and hardbottom locations from the state of Florida and The Nature Conservancy, improves consistency with the Atlantic hardbottom indicator, and more.


In future updates, SECAS staff hope to incorporate GoMMAPPS seabird models into the Blueprint as they become publicly available. The Blueprint will continue to improve its coverage of the Gulf marine environment and the rest of the SECAS geography through its annual revision cycle, incorporating the latest data and feedback from new partners.
