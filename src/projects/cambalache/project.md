In areas where conservation resources are limited, like the U.S. Caribbean, bringing together partners to focus on shared priorities is particularly important. An early version of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint highlighted two focal watersheds in Puerto Rico: the Río Grande de Arecibo and Río Herrera to Cabezas de San Juan. The Río Grande de Arecibo was selected as the primary focal watershed due to the importance of its groundwater and surface water reservoir resources and its potential for improving connectivity between lands and waters. In addition, the need for a shared, cross-organization plan in that region positioned a collaborative effort like SECAS to fill an important gap.


Partner organizations identified enhancing aquatic connectivity as a key conservation action within the watershed, and SECAS has helped make progress by facilitating the identification of problematic dams and culverts. In March 2019, these partner organizations and others collaborated to remove the high-priority Cambalache Dam. Removal of this low-rise dam connected and restored 15 miles of riverine habitat, allowing migratory fish to travel farther upstream. It also eliminated a safety hazard, decreased erosion, and boosted upstream recreational opportunities.

SECAS will continue to help coordinate and support the efforts of partners in the Caribbean to implement the Southeast Blueprint.
