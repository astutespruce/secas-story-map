While forestry and wildlife management clearly share significant common ground, in most states and territories in the Southeast and U.S. Caribbean, they are managed by different agencies. State forestry agencies typically focus on managing forested lands through strategies like invasive species control, prescribed burning, landowner assistance, and more. While fish and wildlife agencies use State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs), forestry agencies use Forest Action Plans (FAPs) to provide a strategic framework for managing their priority resources across the state.

Both the TN Division of Forestry and SC Forestry Commission have incorporated the Southeast Conservation Blueprint into their FAPs. The [SC FAP](https://www.scfc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/forest-action-plan-2020-30.pdf) references the Southeast Blueprint as a resource for identifying regionally important habitats and areas of biodiversity. The [TN FAP](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/agriculture/documents/forestry/2020-tn-fap/2021/2020-TN-FAP.pdf) calls for coordination with SECAS, demonstrating how state forestry priority areas align with the Southeast Blueprint and therefore contribute to the SECAS Goal. In addition, the TN Wildlife Resources Agency and SC Dept. of Natural Resources are in the process of using the Blueprint to inform their upcoming SWAP revisions (alongside 13 other state and territorial fish and wildlife agencies). Both are adding additional chapters showing how they contribute to a regional landscape, and are exploring using the Blueprint to refine their spatial focus areas.

As a consistent regional dataset, the Blueprint can serve as a shared language that bridges the gap between different agencies, helping identify opportunities to collaborate more closely both within and beyond state boundaries.
