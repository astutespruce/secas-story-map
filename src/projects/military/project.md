Over the last two decades, the military and conservation communities have increasingly [found common ground](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/north-carolina/stories-in-north-carolina/red-cockaded-woodpecker-military-conservation/) in the Southeast. Urban growth and habitat loss threaten not only fish, wildlife, and working lands, but also hinder military testing and training activities by encroaching on buffers, obstructing key air space, and isolating rare species on bases. This intersection between natural resources and national defense has emerged as a theme in SECAS' work as partnerships in this nexus increasingly look to the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to provide a landscape-scale perspective.

The [Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability](https://serppas.org/) (SERPPAS) incorporated the Southeast Blueprint into their "Good Map" depicting the priorities of many different partners. SERPPAS brings together leaders from the Dept. of Defense with representatives from federal and state agencies for natural resources and working lands across six states (NC, SC, GA, FL, AL, MS). In addition, planning efforts in Florida and North Carolina involving several different branches of the armed forces have used the Blueprint to map important areas for conservation and military readiness in the face of climate change and urban growth.

The Blueprint has also helped strengthen three successful applications to establish Sentinel Landscapes: the SC Lowcountry, Northwest FL, and Eastern NC. [Sentinel Landscapes](https://sentinellandscapes.org/) are defined geographies anchored by at least one military installation or range that contain priority lands for conservation, working lands, and national defense interests across the Depts. of Defense, Agriculture, and Interior. The goal is to facilitate partnerships, make these key landscapes more competitive for federal funding, and connect landowners with programs to keep working lands working (e.g., voluntary tax reduction programs, agricultural loans, technical aid, conservation easements).

In the [sustainability plan for Robins Air Force Base](https://www.middlegeorgiarc.org/public-administration/rafb-sustainability-plan/), developed in partnership with the Middle Georgia Regional Commission, the Blueprint helped identify priority natural areas in need of conservation within a 10-mile buffer surrounding the base. Finally, on Fort Moore, the Blueprint is helping bring in funding to restore natural streams in places where failing culverts are causing flooding that impedes training and mission readiness. The Blueprint helped advocate for nature-based solutions by communicating the regional benefits of restoring aquatic connectivity for resilience, freshwater species and habitats, and more.
