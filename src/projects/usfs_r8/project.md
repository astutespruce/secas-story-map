The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) has recognized the importance of landscape-scale conservation for decades. The agency periodically updates restoration and management plans for the National Forests located in the 13 Southern states and Puerto Rico. USFS staff realized a need for better regional consistency in evaluating priorities, not only within individual forests, but across the entire landscape.

In response, they developed the Landscape Level Integration and Shared Stewardship (LLISS) platform to empower decision-makers with a better framework to guide conservation actions. The LLISS uses the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help represent regional conservation priorities while using other datasets, like those used to develop the [Southern Forest Assessment Library](https://research.fs.usda.gov/srs/southern-forest-assessment-library), to assess ecosystem condition. By blending these approaches, the framework and tools help the region prioritize based on both an area's importance and the type of action needed (e.g., restoration, protection, management).

In addition, the USFS is using the Southeast Blueprint to help inform funding allocations. To prioritize Southeast firesheds for restoration as part of a short-turnaround request from national leadership, USFS staff overlaid the Blueprint with other regional datasets, including a wildland-urban interface fire risk map. This helped the USFS identify portions of the Ocala National Forest in Florida for supplemental funding as the analyses showed high Blueprint priorities, high fire risk to structures, and high value on local datasets related to ecological condition. These tools all told a consistent story.

The USFS has also used the Blueprint to identify regional priorities for land protection through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, helping advance conservation outcomes in Sumter National Forest in South Carolina, and elsewhere. Nationally, the USFS has incorporated the Blueprint into their [Climate Risk Viewer](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/87744e6b06c74e82916b9b11da218d28) as a layer representing biodiversity and species risk.
