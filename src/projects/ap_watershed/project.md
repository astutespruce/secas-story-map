The Albemarle-Pamlico estuary is the second largest in the country, recognized as an estuary of national significance and one of [America's Great Waters](https://www.npca.org/articles/605-america-s-great-waters-coalition-designates-nine-new-waterways-to-advocate). The surrounding watershed spans two states, encompassing a network of public conservation lands and working lands that nurture abundant plant and animal life. Its economic value measures in the billions, playing an important role in agriculture, commercial fisheries like blue crab and flounder, and tourism at popular destinations like the NC Outer Banks. The watershed also provides outdoor recreation opportunities and ecosystem services to the nearly four million people who live there. Since its inception, SECAS has cultivated strong relationships with the Albemarle-Pamlico conservation community, supporting efforts to attract new funding and recognition and to plan for conservation at a landscape scale.


When the White House allocated $121 million from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to place-based conservation initiatives across the country, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff and partners used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help [bring $27 million of that funding to the Albemarle-Pamlico watershed](https://coastalreview.org/2023/03/albemarle-pamlico-resilience-gets-27-25-million-boost/). The Southeast Blueprint amplified their message about the area's conservation importance and highlighted opportunities to preserve and enhance resilience in a watershed on the front lines of climate change. With this funding, federal, state, and local partners will implement nature-based strategies (like living shorelines and oyster reefs) to enhance climate resilience on public lands. They are also working to use this investment to leverage additional funds to benefit local communities and working lands.


Partners in the Albemarle-Pamlico watershed have used the Blueprint to make a difference in other creative ways, such as helping area National Wildlife Refuges plan for future land acquisition. The Blueprint also helped select the watershed as a focus area for a national interagency coastal wetlands working group, and helped strengthen a successful proposal to the NC Land and Water fund that awarded $2\.4 million for an ambitious wetland restoration project. Recently, the Blueprint supported an application to designate Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge as a Wetland of International Significance under the international [Ramsar Convention on Wetlands](https://www.carolinawetlands.org/ramsar-wetlands-in-the-carolinas), which is still under consideration.
