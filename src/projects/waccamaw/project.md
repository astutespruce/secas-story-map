Along the coast of South Carolina, Waccamaw National Wildlife Refuge serves as an important natural anchor for the Waccamaw River system and the cities of Conway and Myrtle Beach. SECAS staff have been working with the Refuge and its partners for almost a decade to inform land protection and management strategies. The Southeast Conservation Blueprint has served as a shared language to help align conservation efforts on and off the Refuge.


In 2016, spurred by strong community support for additional land protection, the Refuge began [pioneering a new process for modifying its boundary](https://www.americanrivers.org/2020/01/modern-problems-need-new-solutions/) to reflect new conservation opportunities and changing land uses. To move forward, they needed a plan called a Landscape Conservation Design. Refuge staff, collaborating with The Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, and others, used the Southeast Blueprint as a foundational dataset in their design for the greater Coastal Plain ecoregion. It outlined how the Refuge's growth would contribute to a regional strategy, advance partner priorities, and follow the best available science. The Refuge went on to use the Blueprint to support subsequent plans for the new boundary, [which was approved in 2019](https://www.americanrivers.org/media-item/wildlife-refuge-boundary-modification-strengthens-communities-in-the-face-of-climate-change/), as well as an updated spatial habitat management plan.


SECAS also works with the [Upper Waccamaw Task Force](https://winyahrivers.org/upper-waccamaw-task-force/), a partnership for the surrounding watershed that brings together Refuge staff with representatives of nonprofits, local governments, state agencies, and other conservation organizations. Their primary goal is to protect land to benefit landscape-scale conservation, recreational access, ecological heritage, and flood hazard reduction. The task force is using the Blueprint in a land protection strategy that includes a public map of broad priority areas, and a private map of specific tracts to conserve. The parcel-level plan includes nuanced strategies for each area--from connecting Conway to a nearby university through a recreational and wildlife corridor, to filling gaps in connectivity along the river, to buying out flood-prone properties.
