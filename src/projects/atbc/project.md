In 2022, the White House launched a new funding initiative called the [America the Beautiful Challenge](https://www.nfwf.org/programs/america-beautiful-challenge) intended to support and accelerate locally led efforts to conserve and restore land, water, and wildlife across the country. In the first two years of that program, SECAS helped support 27 proposals, 9 of which were successful, bringing almost $25 million to the Southeast! The SECAS Executive Steering Committee identified grasslands restoration and aquatic connectivity as regional priorities for this new funding source, so staff particularly emphasized support for proposals focused on those two issues.


The successful proposals included two planning projects--one to support the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in developing an integrated ecological management plan for their homeland in western North Carolina, and one for the Southeastern Grasslands Initiative to develop a grassland conservation plan for the Cumberland Plateau ecoregion across four states (KY, TN, GA, AL). The remaining proposals funded on-the-ground conservation action by Tribes, state wildlife agencies, and their partners that will improve ecosystem health, function, and connectivity on more than 170,000 acres across 12 states and territories. This work will restore and connect glades, grasslands, and prairies; remove aquatic barriers like dams and culverts; increase prescribed fire; implement nature-based solutions for riparian restoration; and more.


SECAS will continue helping partners strengthen future proposals for America the Beautiful funding by using the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to demonstrate projects' regional significance, linking actions to the SECAS Goal, and showing alignment with the partnership's overarching priorities.
