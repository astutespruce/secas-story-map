The [Tennessee River Basin Network](https://www.trbnetwork.org/) is a conservation partnership working to steward the watershed's exceptional aquatic biodiversity. As part of its efforts to improve water quality, the Network provides funding and technical assistance for a riparian buffer restoration program called Shade Your Stream.


The group used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint and several aquatic indicators--particularly imperiled aquatic species and natural landcover in floodplains--to help rank Shade Your Stream proposals and guide funding to the places where it would make the biggest positive impact. The Southeast Blueprint data helped provide consistent, objective information that spanned multiple states, which was important for evaluating proposals from different states within the Tennessee River Valley.
