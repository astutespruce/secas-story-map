In 2018, the South Carolina chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint as the foundation for an update to their [Conservation Vision](https://tnc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=bff00bd9be57433187919aba94a2ca27). This priority map guides TNC's conservation efforts and informs the work of partners, like local land trusts, statewide. They filtered down the Southeast Blueprint to identify the hubs, corridors, and buffers and restoration areas that align with their mission.

TNC used an early draft of that updated vision to support the successful reauthorization of the [SC Conservation Bank](https://www.sccbank.sc.gov/), an important funding source for land conservation to enhance quality of life for state residents. The Blueprint helped show legislators that the conservation community is prepared to speak with one voice about shared priorities, and can use rigorous scientific data to inform how funding is spent. The Bank has now incorporated the Blueprint into its own prioritization to represent regional corridors and ecological resiliency. Their priority model also uses the equitable access to potential parks indicator, along with many other datasets representing species of concern, sustainable forestry and agriculture, water resources, public recreation, and more.

Partners are now using the Blueprint to strengthen proposals to the Bank for funding. In one example, the Blueprint helped TNC bring in $850,000 from the Bank and $500,000 from [Acres for America](https://www.nfwf.org/programs/acres-america-program) to support the their largest private conservation easement, the [Groton Plantation](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/south-carolina/stories-in-south-carolina/groton-plantation-water-quality-conservation/). Conserving this nearly 14,000-acre property creates a 50-mile corridor along the South Carolina-Georgia border where wildlife can roam without ever leaving protected lands. Groton supports a number of priority wildlife and game species, including bobwhite quail, wild turkey, the federally protected red-cockaded woodpecker, and the at-risk gopher tortoise.

In the words of David Bishop with SC TNC, _"...the SC Conservation Bank called out the application for the Groton project as one of the best they have ever seen, which I think is at least partly the result of your data and document. I think \[Blueprint user support] is a very valuable service and absolutely helped us get money."_
