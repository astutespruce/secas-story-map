Nashville, TN is home to one of the largest intact woodlands of any U.S. city. This crescent of natural forest just 15 minutes' drive from downtown supports a number of popular parks. While city and county plans already recognize the value of preserving and expanding Nashville's "green and open spaces", a coalition known as the [Conserve Nashville's Highland Rim Forest Alliance](https://nashvillehighlandrimforest.org/) is working to ensure those plans become reality. The Alliance, which brings together Nashville residents alongside representatives from government agencies, nonprofits, businesses, and universities, was excited to find that the priorities in the Southeast Conservation Blueprint aligned well with their interest in protecting this unique asset.


The Alliance first used the Southeast Blueprint to formally map their area of interest. They then used information from the Blueprint and its underlying indicators to better communicate to a variety of stakeholders the benefits of conserving this area--including outdoor recreation opportunities, ecosystem services, and species habitat. By demonstrating the value of Nashville's Highland Rim Forest to partners like the Metro Planning Dept., Nashville's Parks and Greenways, the Urban Land Institute, and local government officials, SECAS is helping the Alliance build support for their important work.
