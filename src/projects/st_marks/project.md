The Southeast Conservation Blueprint helped support a successful Cooperative Recovery Initiative grant proposal to conserve threatened frosted flatwoods salamander populations on St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. The funding supported support prescribed burning, salamander surveys, feral hog control, and water quality monitoring. The decline of the salamander is a local symptom of the broader decline in longleaf pine communities across the Southeast. The area around St. Marks is a high priority in the Southeast Blueprint and, as part of a Priority Reptile and Amphibian Conservation Area, scores highly on the reptile and amphibian indicator.


In addition, Wildland Fire Resilient Landscapes funding supported by the Blueprint went toward growing season burns at St. Marks. Growing season burns are critical for maintaining frosted flatwoods salamander habitat because the species relies on ephemeral wetlands that can be overtaken by woody vegetation in the absence of fire, and breeding occurs in the dormant season. Short-term monitoring suggested refuge salamander populations responded positively to those burns.
