The [Keeping Forests as Forests](https://www.keepingforests.org/) initiative (KFAF) is a partnership led by the U.S. Forest Service. KFAF is using the results of a project called Mapping the South's Protected Forests of the Future to identify priority watersheds where partners will focus efforts to preserve and restore forestland in the Southeast. The Southeast Conservation Blueprint plays a significant role in this effort by depicting regional conservation priorities. The project combines the Southeast Blueprint with complementary data from state and federal agencies, nonprofit organizations, private industry, and other conservation partnerships. It incorporates data about protected lands, conservation priorities, development and climate threats, economic value, water quality, and farmland and wetland restoration potential. The project was envisioned to build on the work of SECAS by synthesizing spatial information on the best areas for forest retention and restoration across the region.


KFAF's priority watersheds will serve as the initial focus areas for achieving their goal of conserving 70% of historic forestlands across the Southeast. In the words of KFAF coordinator, Daniel McInnis, *"I do envision that this product, combined with the SECAS Blueprint and other work that's been done, will help inform decisions on where to focus our efforts and where points of leverage exist. This particular future protected forest layer will be critical because we could potentially leverage USFS authorities and Keeping Forests as Forests partners' intersecting priorities alongside these areas slated for protection"* ([from 2017 article by K.
