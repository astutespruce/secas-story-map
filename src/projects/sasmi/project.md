From North Carolina to northern Florida, the South Atlantic region harbors approximately one million acres of salt marsh. These iconic tidal wetlands are vital to the health and sustainability of coastal communities as well as numerous fish and wildlife species. However, salt marshes are threatened by rising seas and other landscape-level challenges like urbanization and habitat fragmentation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 14% to 34% of existing salt marshes along the South Atlantic could be lost by 2060 due to sea-level rise alone.


To address these challenges, in 2021 [The Pew Charitable Trusts](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/07/12/how-southeast-stakeholders-are-safeguarding-salt-marshes) and leaders from the [Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability](https://serppas.org/) launched a regional partnership called the [South Atlantic Salt Marsh Initiative](https://marshforward.org/) (SASMI). SASMI brings together partners around the goal of enhancing the long-term abundance, health and resilience of the one million acres of salt marsh in the South Atlantic to ensure no overall loss of the benefits these wetlands provide to fish, wildlife and people. Working closely with SECAS staff, SASMI used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint during initial stakeholder workshops to help visualize priority places for salt marsh conservation action. SECAS staff also contributed to the [SASMI conservation plan](https://marshforward.org/sasmi-plan/) by drawing on the best available science and consistent regional data to identify coastal wetlands that are more resilient to threats like sea-level rise, erosion, and coastal development, as well as places where coastal wetlands could migrate in the future.


Through SASMI, the conservation community is rallying around salt marsh and working together to make a greater impact than any one partner could accomplish alone. Using the Southeast Blueprint helps partners find the best places to collaborate to achieve the SASMI goal to maintain and enhance the quality and extent of salt marshes, even in the face of future change. For example, National Wildlife Refuges are using the Blueprint to plan for how future land protection can best advance the SASMI goal while also supporting high quality habitat and public recreation.
