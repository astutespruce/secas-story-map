The Southeast Conservation Blueprint, ecosystem indicators, and strong partner relationships in SECAS strengthened a successful proposal that brought in nearly $3 million dollars for prescribed fire. All other funding from this national program, the Dept. of Interior's Wildland Fire Resilient Landscapes, went to the Western United States. SECAS played an important role in bringing some of that funding east of the Mississippi River. The project supported prescribed burning in priority longleaf pine focus areas across the South Atlantic and helped break prescribed fire records in the region! Staff, training, and aerial support were anchored around key longleaf refuges and parks, maintaining and restoring fire not just on federal lands, but on nearby state, private, and non-profit lands as well.


This project has benefited the fire-dependent longleaf pine ecosystem, including many rare species like the red-cockaded woodpecker. The ecosystem indicators also served as shared measures of the project's success, demonstrating the impact of the burns on the overall integrity of the pine and prairie system.
