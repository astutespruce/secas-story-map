The staff of Francis Marion and Sumter National Forests in South Carolina were early adopters of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint, dating back to 2014 when they used an early version that covered just the South Atlantic subregion. They first used the Blueprint to inform the revision of the Francis Marion National Forest Plan. At public meetings, the Blueprint helped the forest planner provide regional context and demonstrate to stakeholders the forest's significance in the larger landscape.


As the collaboration continued, they used the Southeast Blueprint in the SC Land Ownership Adjustment Strategy, a statewide plan that helps the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) optimize their conserved land footprint through strategies like land exchanges, purchases, donations, and sales. The Blueprint helped the plan authors check for gaps to ensure they prioritized the most strategically important parcels.


As USFS staff went on to implement the strategy, the Blueprint helped strengthen grant proposals for [Land and Water Conservation Fund](https://www.doi.gov/lwcf) dollars to protect key tracts. Between 2016 and 2021, the Blueprint helped bring in $21 million to protect 15,000 acres for Francis Marion and Sumter National Forests. In the words of Peggy Jo Nadler, retired USFS Lands Program Manager, *"the Blueprint's maps and analyses provide additional validity to the importance of our projects, makes them more competitive nationally, and helps secure funding for increased federal land protections."*


This support was particularly valuable for justifying proposals in the Piedmont, an ecoregion often overlooked in favor of opportunities in the mountains and Coastal Plain. As part of this process, SECAS connected USFS staff to the [Piedmont Prairie Partnership](https://www.segrasslands.org/piedmont), linking them to regional data and partner networks that helped them better communicate the value of conservation in that area.
