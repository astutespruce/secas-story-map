The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in Texas used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to inform their strategic plan, which outlines where the organization will focus their efforts for the next five years. Of particular interest in the development of the plan were the indicators in the Southeast Blueprint that help to identify priority areas for recreational access. Indicators like potential access to parks help identify places where conservation actions in urban areas can ensure all communities have nearby opportunities to connect with nature.
