The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services manages a national network of more than 570 [National Wildlife Refuges](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wildlife-refuge-system), nearly 200 of which fall within the SECAS geography. The Southeast Conservation Blueprint identifies 95% of their total area as a priority! These public lands make a significant contribution to the SECAS vision of a connected network of lands and waters, providing important wildlife habitat and opportunities for people to connect with nature. So far, SECAS has supported planning efforts and regional decision-making on more than 70 Refuges across 14 states and 2 territories.


Many Refuges have used the Southeast Blueprint as the foundation for their Landscape Conservation Designs, plans required to modify or expand Refuge boundaries that outline how future land protection will contribute to a regional strategy and advance partner priorities. Others are using the Blueprint in their habitat management and land protection plans. The Blueprint has even been used to support the creation of new Refuges and inform their boundaries!


Regionally, the Blueprint has also helped the Refuge System prioritize strategic land acquisition and management decisions, bring in funding for prescribed fire, and plan for how future land protection can best advance shared goals like the salt marsh conservation objectives of the [South Atlantic Salt Marsh Initiative](https://marshforward.org/).
