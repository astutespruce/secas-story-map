The Lower Mississippi River Basin watershed spans about 107,000 square miles and encompasses parts of six states. As part of the largest watershed in the country, it directly funnels water from the mighty Mississippi and its tributaries into the Gulf of America, also serving as a major migratory bird flyway.


In 2023, state and federal partners came together to develop a strategy to use $20 million in conservation funding from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to enhance and restore public lands within four states in the Basin (AR, LA, MS, TN). They focused on nature-based solutions to improve long-term resilience, particularly projects that would mitigate food hazards by restoring hydrology, and sequester carbon through forest health best management practices. The money was shared across State Wildlife Management Areas and National Wildlife Refuges.


Refuge staff worked with SECAS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Migratory Birds, Gulf Restoration, and Ecological Services programs to produce an interactive tool to prioritize projects on Refuge lands. The tool used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to represent regional conservation and connectivity priorities, complementing a number of additional datasets on reforestation benefits to forest breeding birds, flooding frequency, carbon sequestration potential, federally listed and at-risk species, and proximity to underserved communities. Funding ultimately went to 17 high-priority projects across four states in the Lower Mississippi River Basin, benefitting 15 Refuges and Refuge complexes. Projects included wetlands restoration, invasive species control, forest management, bottomland hardwood planting, waterfowl habitat improvements, and more.
