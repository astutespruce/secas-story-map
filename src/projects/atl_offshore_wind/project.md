The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) recently drafted Wind Energy Areas representing the parts of the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf that appear most suitable for commercial wind energy development, while also minimizing conflicts with key environmental resources and user groups. BOEM sought input from federal, state, Tribal, and local partners on the area boundaries.


The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to inform its comments on those draft [Wind Energy Areas in the Central Atlantic Ocean](https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/central-atlantic). NOAA recommended refining the area boundaries to avoid high priority habitat for conservation based on the Southeast Blueprint priorities, one of the indicators representing deep-sea coral and hardbottom, and a number of other datasets.


These Wind Energy Areas have now been finalized, and some of them [sold at auction](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administrations-central-atlantic-offshore-wind-lease-sale-yields-nearly). BOEM is embarking on another round of offshore wind site identification in the Central Atlantic. This serves as an example of how the Blueprint can help support the strategic development of future renewable energy projects across the region by identifying more environmentally suitable areas and avoiding impacts to sensitive resources.
