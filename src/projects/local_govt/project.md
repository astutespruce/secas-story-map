While urban growth is often considered a threat to conservation goals, it also represents an opportunity to collaborate with communities who want to grow sustainably, protect their natural resources, and ensure their residents have access to green space. Working with the Catawba Regional Council of Governments, SECAS staff have helped several city and county governments in upstate South Carolina incorporate the Southeast Conservation Blueprint into their planning documents, better aligning local actions with a regional strategy.


In one example, the town of Fort Mill, SC used the Blueprint to help identify natural resource priorities in their [2040 comprehensive plan](https://fortmillsc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/326/2040-Comprehensive-Plan-PDF), which will guide efforts to conserve habitat, expand outdoor recreation opportunities, envision future land use, and mitigate development impacts. The Blueprint and underlying indicators also helped recommend conservation actions to undertake within these focus areas, such as promoting connectivity, controlling invasive species, and restoring riparian buffers.


Dorchester County, SC, whose residents voted for a greenbelt referendum in 2022, also used the Blueprint in their recent [Greenbelt Master Plan](https://www.dorchestercountysc.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/24675/638539778522770000) to help identify priority areas for future protection. The plan recognizes the key role that open space plays in residents' quality of life, from providing recreation opportunities to reducing flooding and preserving cultural heritage.


In addition, the town of Sandy Springs, GA used the Southeast Blueprint to strengthen a grant proposal that brought in $3 million from the GA Outdoor Stewardship Program. The project is protecting land through conservation easements and expanding outdoor recreation opportunities by extending a multi-use trail network. The Blueprint and underlying connectivity analysis helped town staff speak to the project's ecological value and its contribution to regional corridors.


The city of Tybee Island, GA also used the Blueprint to help bring in $380,000 in coastal resilience funding for a nature-based solution to reduce flooding. By restoring aquatic connectivity and building a living shoreline, this funding will protect residents from extreme weather events while improving salt marsh habitat important for wildlife and fisheries.
