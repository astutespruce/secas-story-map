The U.S. Caribbean is a global biodiversity hotspot and home to numerous endemic species, many of which are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Using preliminary data developed for version 2023 of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint, SECAS staff helped our partners at the USVI Dept. of Planning and Natural Resources secure a Recovery Land Acquisition grant to support recovery efforts for four listed species: the leatherback sea turtle ([*Dermochelys coriacea*](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/1493)), St. Croix ground lizard ([*Pholidoscelis polops*](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/5154)), Eggers' century plant ([*Agave eggersiana*](https://www.fws.gov/species/eggers-century-plant-agave-eggersiana)), and rare plant [*Catesbaea melanocarpa*](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/722). This funding source focuses on land protection to benefit listed species that are threatened by habitat loss.


The nearly $1\.4 million awarded will permanently protect key habitat on St. Croix that is at risk of conversion to utility-scale solar energy development. It also contributes to a larger effort to connect protected areas across the island for enhanced resiliency by linking uplands, beaches, and nearshore marine ecosystems. In addition, this project supports the newly established territorial park system in the U.S. Virgin Islands and will improve access to conserved green space for St. Croix residents.
