Natural shorelines and barrier islands play an important role in protecting coastal communities and ecosystems from storms. They also provide valuable habitat for birds, fish and shellfish, sea turtles, and more. In the absence of human development, the coastline constantly shifts in response to waves and weather, allowing it to sustain the ecosystem services we rely on. Urban growth and shoreline armoring try to hold this dynamic system in place, causing habitat loss and making our coasts more vulnerable to erosion and sea-level rise.


To encourage the conservation of key coastlines and barrier islands, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act withdraws the availability of most new federal funding and financial assistance, such as flood insurance, within areas designated as part of the [Coastal Barrier Resources System](https://www.fws.gov/program/coastal-barrier-resources-act) (CBRS). The CBRS contains about 3\.5 million acres of wetlands and barrier islands that were mostly natural and undeveloped at the time of designation. The law adopts the sensible approach that the risk associated with development in these areas should be borne by private sector and not underwritten by the American taxpayer.


[This system has proved effective](https://www.fws.gov/story/studies-examine-cbras-effectiveness-saving-money-and-reducing-development) in discouraging development in storm- and flood-prone locations; development rates (including shoreline armoring) within the CBRS are more than 75% lower than areas outside it. Additionally, the CBRS is effective in reducing federal disaster spending. One study found that the Act saved $9\.5 billion between 1989 and 2013, and projects it may save as much as $108 billion by 2068!


FWS staff are using the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help assess and communicate the benefits of the Act in the Southeast. The Blueprint prioritizes about 90% of the areas within the Southeast CBRS. Given that the Blueprint prioritizes 50% of the Southeast landscape overall, this highlights the regional conservation importance of the CBRS. The Blueprint is demonstrating how the CBRS helps prevent the loss of habitat that is important for resilience and connectivity.
