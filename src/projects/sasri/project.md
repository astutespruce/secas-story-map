The [Southern Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative](https://southernspruce.org/) (SASRI) is a partnership of private, state, federal, and non-governmental organizations working to restore spruce-fir forests across the high-elevation landscapes of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains. Spruce-fir is a relic of the last ice age that found refuge atop the highest peaks of the Appalachians, supporting a unique suite of plant and animal species, some of which are found nowhere else in the world. These forests have still not recovered from extensive logging in the late 1800s through early 1900s, which were often followed by catastrophic wildfires. Today, the spruce-fir ecosystem faces serious threats from climate change and is considered the second-most endangered forested ecosystem in the country.


In 2023, SASRI used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help secure $354,000 from the [Appalachia Keystone Initiative](https://www.doi.gov/media/document/appalachia-keystone-initiative), part of a restoration and resilience framework funded by the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. This funding will build partnership capacity, prioritize restoration, and improve coordination and monitoring of spruce-fir restoration in the Southern Appalachians. The Southeast Blueprint helped strengthen the proposal by demonstrating the regional importance of spruce-fir sky islands. The proposal also lays the groundwork for closer collaboration with SECAS to improve the Blueprint's coverage of spruce-fir communities in the future.
