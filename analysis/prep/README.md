# SECAS Projects data preparation

The SECAS boundary and SECAS states were prepared as part of the the [Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer](https://github.com/astutespruce/secas-blueprint) project and
saved to:

- `data/boundaries/se_boundary.fgb`.
- `data/boundaries/states.fgb`

These boundaries were saved to PMTiles using `analysis/prep/create_tiles.py`.
